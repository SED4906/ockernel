here's the bare minimum since i really don't want to write a readme right now

# building
run `set-target.sh` with any posix compatible shell to set the target architecture and platform, then `cargo build --release` to actually build the kernel

# architecture support
currently the only architecture supported is `i586` and the only platform supported is `ibmpc`
